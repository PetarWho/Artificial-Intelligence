Problem Statement\n","\n","In this project I address the challenge of learning control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs—in our case, video frames from Atari games. Learning directly from raw pixels poses several challenges:\n","\n","- **High-Dimensional Inputs:** The raw images *(e.g., 210 × 160 RGB frames)* contain a vast amount of data, much of which is irrelevant for decision making.\n","- **Sparse and Delayed Rewards:** In many Atari games, rewards are infrequent and delayed, making it difficult to associate actions with long-term outcomes.\n","- Sample Inefficiency: Standard reinforcement learning methods often require millions of interactions with the environment.\n","\n","Our goal is to implement a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** that can learn an effective control policy by approximating the Q-function directly from raw input. We also incorporate saving and loading functionalities so that once trained, the model can be reused without needing to retrain from scratch, which is a crucial factor given the long training times."],"metadata":{"id":"Cs7pC2zPKHKa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.
