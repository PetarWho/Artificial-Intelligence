France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Great service and wine but inedible food,,sadly i used the high tripadvisor rating too literally we have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so know that amazing buzz from a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef never before have we eaten a tasting menu and never will we again ad hoc has a great ambience with attentive friendly service and all the paired wines were exceptional maybe we hit a night when the chef was off but every single course of food was certainly not freshly cooked and as we passed the kitchen on the way to the bathroom noticed plates of precooked food ready to go on the tasting menu plates if it had been the odd dish that disappointed we would have accepted that it might have just been our palates not liking it as it was every plate of food was not hot bland lacking any spark and had probably been sitting around for a whilel all the serving staff were great as was the wine but i failed to finish any plate offered the tasting menu looked good value but a simple bowl of hot freshly cooked pasta would have done better justice to the wine when asked i admitted with that great english understatement that i had been disappointed i found euros had been deducted from the euro bill so it was nice that they noticed probably best to avoid the tasting menus and enjoy their great wine selection with some pasta and maybe cheese course i feel responsible that i made a poor choice not realizing that this is a place geared for tourists an expensive mistake,279,"['sadli', 'use', 'high', 'tripadvisor', 'rate', 'liter', 'fortun', 'eat', 'number', 'fine', 'restaur', 'know', 'amaz', 'buzz', 'mouth', 'fine', 'freshli', 'cook', 'food', 'great', 'chef', 'eaten_NEG', 'tast', 'menu', 'ad_NEG', 'hoc', 'great', 'ambienc', 'attent', 'friendli', 'servic', 'pair', 'wine', 'except', 'mayb', 'hit', 'night', 'chef', 'everi', 'singl', 'cours', 'food', 'certainli', 'freshli', 'cook', 'pa', 'kitchen', 'way', 'bathroom', 'notic', 'plate', 'precook', 'food', 'readi', 'go', 'tast', 'menu', 'plate', 'odd', 'dish', 'disappoint', 'would', 'accept', 'might', 'palat', 'like', 'everi', 'plate', 'food', 'hot', 'bland', 'lack', 'spark', 'probabl', 'sit', 'around', 'whilel', 'serv', 'staff', 'great', 'wine', 'fail', 'finish', 'plate', 'offer', 'tast', 'menu', 'look', 'good', 'valu', 'simpl', 'bowl', 'hot', 'freshli', 'cook', 'pasta', 'would', 'done', 'better', 'justic', 'wine', 'ask', 'admit', 'great', 'english', 'understat', 'disappoint', 'found', 'euro', 'deduct', 'euro', 'bill', 'nice', 'notic', 'probabl', 'best', 'avoid', 'tast', 'menu', 'enjoy', 'great', 'wine', 'select', 'pasta', 'mayb', 'chees', 'cours', 'feel', 'respons', 'made', 'poor', 'choic', 'realiz', 'place', 'gear', 'tourist', 'expens', 'mistak']",sadli use high tripadvisor rate liter fortun eat number fine restaur know amaz buzz mouth fine freshli cook food great chef eaten_NEG tast menu ad_NEG hoc great ambienc attent friendli servic pair wine except mayb hit night chef everi singl cours food certainli freshli cook pa kitchen way bathroom notic plate precook food readi go tast menu plate odd dish disappoint would accept might palat like everi plate food hot bland lack spark probabl sit around whilel serv staff great wine fail finish plate offer tast menu look good valu simpl bowl hot freshli cook pasta would done better justic wine ask admit great english understat disappoint found euro deduct euro bill nice notic probabl best avoid tast menu enjoy great wine select pasta mayb chees cours feel respons made poor choic realiz place gear tourist expens mistak

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Regrettable food-- cold pasta carbonara in Rome,,i dont write negative reviews id rather say nothing because everybody can have an off night and ive worked in food and know how tough it can be but one thing out of several missteps prompted me to write this i hope i save someone who really wants to experience good roman food from disappointment and its not hard to find good food in rome first this is tourist food upscale to be sure the focus on truffles is not really representative of roman cuisine if thats what you what you can get that type of menu in many upscale hotels in many places i could tolerate thatit is what it is had our food been served appropriatelyi went for the roman menu hoping for tradition and creativity to meet well my partner went for the land menu both suffered the same problem some of this food was cooked way ahead that can be done with some things but not others dishes that should have been hot were served cold im talking cold gummy pasta carbonara people another dishintended to be hot was warm in one part and not just cold but ice cold in another that is just not excusable service this evening was also chaotic but i felt bad for the young women who were dealing with some top tourist groups and only one of them seemed to be a professional server ive been coming to rome for years and i have never experienced anything like this we decided to pay and leave after the pasta debacle i actually sent it back and waited minutes for the server to return with a replacementnever happened even though we werent halfway through the fixed menu the poor server was very apologetic and refused to let us pay im hoping this was a problematic evening and wont occur again although im pretty sure much of the food is made too far ahead fried foods much be served subito the fritti were lukewarm going on cold or the food isnt getting from kitchen to table promptly i should have known better but i trusted reviews and even recommendations from travel advisors i know if you are planning for this to be your splurge in rome you might think twice about it my advice go simple in rome its almost always good if not

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Far behind expectations - what did we miss?,,after several recommendations and a quick read through on ta feedbacks we booked ad hoc for our last night in rome we are both global travelers and we know a good restaurant from a great this ended up as neither of the two we arrived with expectations and our expectations were raised even further after being escorted to our table the interior is inviting with romantic seating and wine bottles covering the wall from floor to ceiling prosecco as a complimentary aperitif is never wrong either we received the menu and decided to go with the truffle tasting menu despite being slightly off season we went with full wine pairing and from here and out our expectations were thrown off a cliff the one thing that surprised us the most was the constant waitingwhich we could easily notice being a distraction for the tables next to us as well there was an extreme amount of dead time between the courses and this is where we found the wine pairing to be a mistake the wines offered as part of the wine package were well balanced with the courses served but in small servings with minutes to the next course and with no offers for a refill or other supplementary drinks weird food started off well with a variety of starters cheese deep fried veggies and truffles as front runners the starter was heavybut rather pleasant last one on the plate was a beef tartare unseasoned as they felt we should season by taste ourselves what pasta course was a duo of pastas both creamy and cheesy and heavy loaded with truffle shavings id loved it if this was the only heavy course but already by now the meal is loosing balance there are no vegetables and no acidity to balance the weight of creamcheesetruffles main course duck breast and beef cheek loaded with truffles duck breast cold and rubbery beef cheek cold and tastelesssalty if anything at all we sent it back and started to loose patience decided to wait for desserts all good but guess what all creamy and heavy a fresh sorbet could have saved half the day but was unfortunately not part of the game all in all i can only recommend the wines servedalthough served in a strange waybottles were never brought to the table we had the main courses removed from our bill which helped on our moodalthough i took that more or less for granted sorry to say this

we felt immediatly uncomfortable with the temperature of the room despite a very visible and working heating system there were permanent flows of cold and hot airs in the room we complained to the head waitress the boss who said they have a problem with the door in fact even when the door was completly closed the issue with the temperature was more or less the same and said she will do her best to move us to another table this did not happen despite a table that we could see became available at some stage and stayed free for may be minutes at the end of the dinner during which my wife kept her coat we asked why she did not move us to the other table and she said believe it or not because it is a table for four and you are only threetranslation i do not care about your health but i care about making money even if i have to overpromise for this generally speaking we found that the head waitress the boss overpromised on everything during this dinnerand underdelivered regarding food the truffle experience was expensive and disappointing we would rate the food somewhere between nothing special for the pasta and bad for the duck which was served dry when we asked medium rare we noticed that people at the table next to us complained about the beef the tuscany red wine was goodbut do you need to introduce it with tons of words and superlatives as you would do for a chateau petrus the service was very very longit took one hour to get the first course and then another hour to get the second one and nothing seemed really properly organised and managed when we decided to stop the experience before the dessert and asked for the bill the head waitress the boss asked about our feeling we told us exactly what was our view big problem with the temperature no transfer to the other table when it was available nothing special at best with the food and good wine she said several times she was confused but did not seem to be so confusedmore a bad actress than a good head waitress or a boss the bill included a discount which seems to be applicable when you make an internet bookingbut we realized after we left the restaurant that our first courses were charged at € vs € based on other reviews we believe it is because the black trufle was partly replaced by white trufle this was our choice but when this option was proposed by the waitress she never mentioned we have to pay an extra for this finally when we asked for our coats a waitress gave us a probably very expensive moncler down jacketwhich was not belonging to us imagine what could have happened with clients less honest than we aredont go there with expensive coats never again and fyi we are used to go to all sort of restaurants privately or because of our jobs from small local restaurants to michelin restaurants see our other reviews and we believe we are able to make the difference between good and bad food good and bad service etc,641,"['wife', 'son', 'terribl', 'experi', 'adhoc', 'thursday',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Wish we had gone some place else for special occasion,,i really wanted to like this place we had our year anniversary in rome and after i found out my first choice was closed for the summer holidays we decided this would be perfect now we were a party of ordered the truffle tasting menu one the land menu and the other they created a truffle tasting menu for vegetarians all with matching wines bill came to odd eurosso wasnt a cheap meal but nor was is great firstly and perhaps those that dont order the truffles will get a better experience but i found the menu to be unimaginative and merely they just put slices of truffle on everything it started with being presented with a small table spoon of cold mash potato compliments of the chef they saidum ok wasnt particularly tasty i left half of mine then came the tasting plate this was perhaps the nicest of all the dishes a plate segmented into with a cold battered pumpkin flower a burrata and the poorest excuse of steak tartar i have ever seen simply a square of raw mince and slices of truffle no capers nothing else the pasta was presented two of them however they tasted exactly the samei liked them but wondered why you would put two of essentially the same pasta of the same plate this was also an issue as the pasta was on this silly little plate and whilst eating one side the other got cold so again that wasnt very nice next the mains tiny slices of dry over cooked duck breast with sliced truffle on what appeared to be the same cold potato we got at the start and a beef cheek thing which was nice but some what confused in the whole tasting menu you did however get a very good amount of trufflesthis i cant fault them of i however would recommend that people dont do the tasting menu rather order from the main menu and perhaps order an item or with truffles finally we had what will perhaps be the worst tiramisu i have every ordered it tasted like it was one layer of biscuit and then they got some of the whipped cream in a can and sprayed on topnot nice maybe at the cheese cake factory but not at a decent restaurant now the final and somewhat laughable moment some of our group wanted to buy fresh truffles they went to the back and were presented with fresh black truffles how much we ask euro a kiloumm no next morning we go to campo di fiori ask the vendor who talks to a guy price euro a kilo so in short no i wouldnt recommend dining here glad we caught up with our friends just wish it was a better meal i am sure my experience wont stop people from attending and perhaps we ordered poorly i just didnt like it for the reasons given above,502,"['realli', 'want', 'like', 'place', 'year', 'anniversari', 'rome', 'found', 'first', 'choic', 'close',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Beyond Disappointing!,,i recently arrived about five minutes early for a pm dinner reservation on a saturday evening i had planned on doing the tasting menu as it was the last evening of my holiday the reviews on trip advisor were relatively positive so this helped to drive my dining decision for that evening upon arrival at the restaurant there was no host or hostess at the door to greet customers i understand that service is quite lacking in italy and not up to american standards but a simple greeting is not much to expect i observed two rather haggard looking servers who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off as the restaurant was pretty full my guest and i were finally greeted by one of the servers who was a bit snarly she sat us at our table which faced both the front door and the service station so it really wasnt the best seat in the house i was disappointed but there really was not anything that we could do about it we were presented with menus after about a minute wait and then our server disappeared to assist with other tables after about minutes she came over and took our order including our wine order but then disappeared each time that we tried to flag her down she just rolled her eyes at us and ran to assist the other server or other tables after another minutes she came back and informed us that the wine that we had ordered was no longer available i then proceeded to select another wine she then returned to the table minutes later with the new bottle the appalling part is that she simply slammed the bottle down on the table and then ran off to assist another table without opening our wine im really not sure why but her behavior was unprofessional and downright insulting so now after minutes of sitting at the table we still had no wine or food this was probably some of the sloppiest and rudest service that i have ever experienced this is not the way that we envisioned our last meal in rome my guest and i ultimately decided to leave and find a restaurant that appreciated our business as such we simply got up and left the funny part is that neither server even noticed that we were leaving or had left as they were too busy with other tables hopefully if youre seeking out a fine dining experience which should include superior service in addition to good food i would suggest looking elsewhere youve been duly warned,441,"['recent', 'arriv', 'five', 'minut', 'earli', 'pm', 'dinner', 'reserv', 'saturday', 'even', 'plan', 'tast', 'menu', 'last', 'even', 'holiday',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Would NOT recommend,,my boyfriend and i visited the ad hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in rome we had read fantastic reviews and were really keen to go we actually tired to book on our first evening to no avail as it was fully booked having secured a table for our last night we were looking forward to a fantastic meal we arrived and were greeted by a friendlyish blonde lady in a rather short skirt and were shown to our table we were seated for at least minutes if not more before anyone came over to offer us a menudrink etc but were willing to overlook this because of the fantastic reputation we finally had sight of a menu not before being told that the prawns and cod were unavailable for the evening we placed our order and thought all was well until the waitress came over to confirm what my boyfriend had ordered because in her words she was confused not something you expect when paying the prices they ask for we were then served an apperetife by a different waitress and shown the wine list finally the apperetife was lovely and we decided to order a bottle of riesling wine to go with out food not before having been told that they might not have it due to a busy night the night before again not what you would expect when paying through the nose for a gastronomic experience after a long wait our main courses finally arrived although sadly all i could taste was an unhealthy level of salt over the main dish and the sides we mentioned to the waitress after finishing our main courses that this was the case and she acknowledged this having not checked our food and asked if we were ok the whole way through the meal we were then left at our table for a fairly solid amount of time during which we witnessed what was frankly a shocking display between two members of staff curiously both the staff members who had served us engaging in a full blown argument which included raising voices in front of guests slamming plates and menus and even resulted in the manager becoming involved as an aside the table next to us had ordered the taster menu and when their food arrived the waitress the same one serving us had to question the food she was serving them as she couldnt remember what it was and then proceeded to swap the plates round twice because she could not remember who had ordered what we were then asked whether we would like a desert to which we replied no and asked for the bill we were then asked to come over to the window tables because the card machine would not work where we were sitting upon delivery of our bill we were also issued with a feedback form on which we commented that the food had been average and certainly not what you would expect for the price and the service had been terrible the only saving grace of the evening was the bottle of sparkling wine which every female guest was given upon departure we are a young couple in our mid twenties and are lucky enough to have eaten in some of the worlds best restaurants we are not overly fussy but the service we received at ad hoc was absolutely disgraceful in terms of the way the staff were behaving in front of paying customers and we would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to anyone we were offered no discount and the meal cost us € i urge you to think twice before you consider going for a meal here not cheap and disappointingly average food but we could have overlooked this had the service been exceptional which it certainly was not,646,"['boyfriend', 'visit', 'ad', 'hoc', 'restaur', 'second',

at ad hoc for our last meal of our day italian vacation my rd trip to rome i did a lot of research and spent a lot of time choosing our restaurants for dinner we were really looking forward to ad hoc on our last night in rome i now find it hard to believe all of the good reviews on trip advisor before anyone books a reservation i would urge you to read the less favorable reviews you will find consistent themes slow poor service average food high prices based upon the reviews i expected the service to be extremely slow it was beyond thatwe and the other tables around us went through long periods of at least minutes without ever seeing a waitress a couple of quick notes the place is beautifulvery nicely decorated and comfortable elegant setting the food is very average i had the cacio e pepe sea bass and italian cheese appetizernone of the food was that good my girlfriend had a pasta dish that was goodbut not great considering all of the phenomenal food elsewhere on our trip the service is awful we live in los angeles and im orginally from ny we are used to good and poor service in restaurants i can even excuse poor service if the food is exceptional that was not the case here first we were seated at the same time as other tables with couples and provided menus i noticed the other tables were provided with wine lists but we were not waitress came by and asked if we wanted still or sparkling waterbut no mention of wine i decided i would wait to see if she noticed minutes later she comes by to take our orderno mention of wine minutes laterappetizers come minutes later appetizer plates are cleared minutes later main course arrives at this point waitress asked oh im sorrydo you want wine i respectfully declined an hour after serving us our main course they finally clear the plates another hour goes by and nobody comes to our table to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee finally after more than frustrating hours i politlely ask for the check after minutesno check so i finally get up and track down a waitress and ask again for the check she responded very coldlyim trying to pay my bill to be clearwe noticed the same situation occuring with other tables around us one couple sitting at the table directly in front of us where clearly unhappy and uncomfortable with the slow service they were constantly looking around for a waitress my fiance noticed a guy dining alone sitting directly behind me she felt bad for him because he was seated and then left at the table without anything for minutes before a waitress came to his table this was an overall regrettable experience this place could be a great restaurantbut with bad service and average food and outrageous pricesthere are plenty of better options in rome save your money and find

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Terrible service,,i reserved a table for about a month before my trip to rome because of the rave reviews on tripadvisor i am sorry to report back with an extremely negative review and i hope that im the only one who experienced this we arrived on time and was greeted by a lovely waitress and we told them who we were it took them a rather long time to search for my reservation and seated us at the worst table possible in the entire restaurant right beside a serving counter where all the dirty dishes were we were looking at the back the entire night this became a major problem when we wanted to ask for the bill and in general got forgotten the whole night we were in clear view of all the dirty dishes the chaos the drama and the waitress talk all of which should be kept behind the scenes and not shown to us the time difference between us finishing our course and the next course took more than minutes when we finished a course the dishes were also cleared about minutes later so we spent most of the time looking at time trying to get their attention waiting for them to clear our dishes while they zoomed in and out of their counter oblivious to our increasing impatience i honestly felt that they could have given us a better table since i reserved a month to in advance the service and the waiting made the entire experience really miserable it was such a nightmare trying to get their attention that we asked for the bill at the same time when we reminded them that we had a dessert that was not yet served it is a pity that the lack of service has to ruin the chefs effort because the food there is pretty good but without the appropriate staff and amount of manpower the restaurant just ruins the entire experience i dont require the staff to smile and be exceptionally friendly but the waiting and the inattentiveness really bothers me i hope that the management will solve this and perhaps try not to seat anyone near the counter,372,"['reserv', 'tabl', 'month', 'trip', 'rome', 'rave', 'review', 'tripadvisor', 'sorri', 'report', 'back', 'extrem', 'neg', 'review', 'hope', 'im', 'one', 'experienc', 'arriv', 'time', 'greet', 'love', 'waitress', 'told', 'took', 'rather', 'long', 'time', 'search', 'reserv', 'seat', 'u', 'worst', 'tabl', 'possibl', 'entir', 'restaur', 'right', 'besid', 'serv', 'counter', 'dirti', 'dish', 'look', 'back', 'entir', 'night', 'becam', 'major', 'problem', 'want', 'ask', 'bill', 'gener', 'got', 'forgotten', 'whole', 'night', 'clear', 'view', 'dirti', 'dish', 'chao', 'drama', 'waitress', 'talk', 'kept', 'behind', 'scene', 'shown', 'u', 'time', 'differ', 'u', 'finish', 'cours', 'next', 'cours', 'took', 'minut', 'finish', 'cours', 'dish', 'also', 'clear', 'minut', 'later', 'spent', 'time', 'look', 'time', 'tri', 'get', 'attent', 'wait', 'clear', 'dish', 'zoom', 'counter', 'oblivi', 'increas', 'impati', 'honestli', 'felt', 'could', 'given', 'u', 'better', 'tabl', 'sinc', 'reserv', 'month', 'advanc', 'servic', 'wait', 'made', 'entir', 'experi', 'realli', 'miser', 'nightmar', 'tri', 'get', 'attent', 'ask', 'bill', 'time', 'remind', 'dessert', 'yet', 'serv', 'piti', 'lack', 'servic', 'ruin', 'chef', 'effort', 'food', 'pretti', 'good', 'without', 'appropri', 'staff', 'amount', 'manpow', 'restaur', 'ruin', 'entir', 'experi', 'dont', 'requir', 'staff', 'smile', 'except', 'friendli', 'wait', 'inattent', 'realli', 'bother', 'hope', 'manag', 'solv', 'perhap', 'tri', 'seat', 'anyon', 'near', 'counter']",reserv tabl month trip rome rave review tripadvisor sorri report back extrem neg review hope im one experienc arriv time greet love waitress told took rather long time search reserv seat u worst tabl possibl entir restaur right besid serv counter dirti dish look back entir night becam major problem want ask bill gener got forgotten whole night clear view dirti dish chao drama waitress talk kept behind scene shown u time differ u finish cours next cours took minut finish cours dish also clear minut later spent time look time tri get attent wait clear dish zoom counter oblivi increas impati honestli felt could given u better tabl sinc reserv month advanc servic wait made entir experi realli miser nightmar tri get attent ask bill time remind dessert yet serv piti lack servic ruin chef effort food pretti good without appropri staff amount manpow restaur ruin entir experi dont requir staff smile except friendli wait inattent realli bother hope manag solv perhap tri seat anyon near counter

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Our worst dining experience in Rome,,having had some really good food during our stay in rome some meals costing only a few euros we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on ta it was a memorable evening unfortunately for all the wrong reasons we made a reservation an hour before although they will have you believe the restaurant is so exclusive you must book a long way ahead there were empty tables the night we went the specialism at this venue is a tasting menu accompanied by wine with each course at a cost of between euros and euros we went for this as the individual menu was also very expensive having been at the restaurant over an hour we had only just had our cold starter which although pretty to look at tasted of nothing almost an hour after that we were served a pasta course which for me was different variations on pasta carbonara again nicely presented but almost cold i would have sent it back but couldnt catch anyones eye therfore most of it was left and when the waitress came for the plates i told her i was disappointed in the dish she said she was sorry i was disappointed we had been in the restaurant almost and a half hours before the main course arrived by which time another party of had left before finishing their courses as only one of them spoke english or italian they were at somewhat of a disavantage but were clearly unhappy and again there was a bland response to their concerns when our main course arrived i again said how disappointed i was with the experience thus far and that as it was now almost pm my appetite had waned the lady serving said it wasnt her fault they were at the mercy of the kitchen and chef so i offered to spaek personally to the chef manager owner whoever was available my offer was not taken up but several minutes later i was approached by another member of waiting staff who had come to tell me that my choice of desert was no longer available and would i like strudel i declined and repeated my disappointment with the restaurant overall she said she was sorry but the problem clearly lay with me as another customer had that evening had the same menu as i and he had enjoyed it and perhaps i lacked appreciation that all the food was freshly cooked my response was that i could have cooked fresh carbonara in a lot less time than almost hours plus and also produced it hot enough to eat she seemed keen to engage me in an arguement which i declined and we left soon after having spent hours and over euros for a mediocre meal in a very pretentious atmosphere which showed you dont always get what you pay for they deducted euros from the bill in consideration of the desert being unavailable on the plus side the wine courses were good not great but good and my husband said his beef was of the best quality in summary if pretentious snobbishness with astronomical prices appeals more than good honest food then this is the place to go but there are far better places in rome with better food and service at a fraction of these prices,572,"['realli', 'good', 'food', 'stay', 'rome', 'meal', 'cost', 'euro',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated Tourist Trap,,living in rome for almost five years we have explored the roman food scene and have truly found some gems over the years though we have become somewhat complacent with our bubble of comfortable restaurants that we have discovered now about to move from rome i got curious and checked trip advisor to see what others had thought of our beloved restaurants surprisingly most of the highest rated restaurants i had never been to seeing this i got ever more curious perhaps we had missed out on a whole series of incredible restaurants in rome we decided to find out ad hoc was our first challenge to our previous favorites in rome me my mother and girlfriend were excited rated so highly on trip advisor i was truly expecting something above and beyond the rest the evening started well we walked in without reservations and were seated promptly directly next to the hostess’s desk where they make reservations the waitress kindly welcomed us and everything seemed to be going well the décor was also deliberate and designed unlike most of the humble family restaurants in rome where you are likely to see the walls decorated with a mosaic of football memorabilia from forza roma and photos of italian movie actors and actresses from the s this was refreshing for rome despite the fact that it definitely felt a little forced the only disconcerting thing so far was the fact that there wasn’t an italian customer in sight a few english speaking customers surrounded us and a german family was within sight in the other room after being seated we were all served complimentary prossecco the bread was notably good also not a bad start at all the menu looked exciting as well it is uncommon in rome to find a chef willing to experiment the menu contained twists on local roman classics as well as a list of dishes with truffles used as their main flavor and inspiration i ordered the “ad hoc” gnocchi my mother ordered the cacio e peppe and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara three ways we also tried a few appetizers roman style artichokes fried pumpkin flowers and some fried cheese wrap that is where the romance ended first one wine we ordered tasted as if it were watered down i dont know any other way to describe it we are not exactly wine snobs but this wine was genuinely awful we ordered a different wine and it was better but still bad the third was decent the appetizers all fried seemed as if they had been fried earlier and reheated somehow later one of the fried cheese balls was actually room temperature the food both appetizers and main courses were lacking flavor the textures were off everything was slightly warm but verging on room temperature felt reheated the carbonara was very very sad some of the worst we have ever had strange bland gnocchi soggy fried appetizers caricatures of roman classics the best was the caccio e pepe which was below average everything was lacking punch depressing attempts at experimental to be blunt the food was awful far below average for rome at above average prices they also had a bizarre ritual of checking the reservation book before letting people in even though they obviously knew that there were plenty of open seats a depressing performance art on the good side the service was very attentive very helpful no problems with the wait as other reviewers had described when we left we were given a free bottle of prosecco i am not sure if this because they thought we didnt enjoy our experience but it was appreciated overall this place is a tourist trap there is a reason you dont see italians here,628,"['live', 'rome', 'almost', 'five', 'year', 'explor', 'roman', 'food', 'scene', 'truli', 'found', 'gem', 'year', 'though', 'becom', 'somewhat',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Uncomfortbale and disappointing,,my good friend and i decided to try ad hoc after many times of walking past after our full days of shopping in the city center as soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadnt been organized dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages ignoring this eye sore we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably it was also filled with tired tourists making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want also the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level so everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine also to fetch a bottle of wine a waitress would have to interupt your dinner to manouevre it off the shelf because everything was so cluttered and cramped you felt you had to whisper and watch what you said during dinner so that the entire restaurant wouldnt hear your conversation not ok so trying to ignore the tacky and cramped interior we had only high hopes for the food the plates came out and were very lovely giving any reasonable person an expectaion of a delicious and gourmet meal every course was un utter disappointment the food tasted like a any run of the mill restaurant absolutely not worth the price or even half the price the portions were tiny and mediorcre at best though trying to be pretentious and superior all night we had no idea who our waitress was and what language to speak to them in as they kept mixing english and italian so to end a compete let down of a night i was brought the absolute worst tiramsu of all time no exaggeration it was disgusting it tasted like watered down american coffee with a dollop of cream on top and soggy bread i took one bite and pushed it away all in all this was a complete waste of money as the food was insanely expensive time and of a perfectly good evening with a girl friend that could have been spent somewhere else more chic tasty authentic and altogether more pleasant and comfortable if you ask me go somewhere else,410,"['good', 'friend', 'decid', 'tri', 'ad', 'hoc', 'mani', 'time', 'walk', 'past', 'full',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",,visited ad hoc for nye with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening it was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of euros each we arrived at pm and were greeted with a small glass of prosecco a nice touch but we then waited hour for our starter and our first glass of wine the starter was very average we then waited hours for our main and we we still hadnt had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine the waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had glass of prosecco and glass of wine in hours was just not good enough the two couples next to us also asked for more wine one lady was literally falling asleep at the table two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake the main was again very average and cold the sea menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food we complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further minutes at least the atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had glasses of wine all evening so the new year came and went without many people noticing the couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight we had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types overall the service was average and very very slow at euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average we believe the ad hoc tasting menu with wine is normally euros and i think hiking the price up to euros per person was a mistake as the food service did not live up to the price we have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a nye meal for the price they charged we wish we had popped into a local trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the pizazza del popolo incidentally we had planned to watch the fireworks in the piazza del popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took hours a very very disappointing evening,436,"['visit', 'ad', 'hoc', 'nye', 'husband', 'disappoint', 'even', 'set', 'menu', 'wine', 'pair', 'set', 'price', 'euro',

since we had been really overeating the whole trip and i hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant we decided to just go for the secondi piatti and skip the antipasti well good for us that we did we did get the complementary sparkling white whine and then went for the lobster on my part and four tryout meatcourses for hubby i agree with others the servings were really small and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway plates were cold sucking the warmth out of the food my lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold dry rice lobster was ok as the strings of honeyglazed lemons as a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew and the parmeggiano well i am no expert but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano dry and tasteless my husbands glass of wine was more like one fourth glass and measured digitally mind you we wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it and really didn´t touch it but lo and behold they charged us for the bread not even in the cheapest joint but here oh yes and € it was by the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the eversweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh thank god for speaking an unusual language swedish and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot the whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man the owner kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant at one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice but to no avail he remained very serous end stern everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill so strange and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this if so eager why didn´t he do the charging himself all in all a total flop for the prices they charge there are so many other good restaurants in rome so do avoid this one,510,"['day', 'vacat', 'itali', 'want', 'realli', 'special', 'meal',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",,visited ad hoc for nye with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening it was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of euros each we arrived at pm and were greeted with a small glass of prosecco a nice touch but we then waited hour for our starter and our first glass of wine the starter was very average we then waited hours for our main and we we still hadnt had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine the waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had glass of prosecco and glass of wine in hours was just not good enough the two couples next to us also asked for more wine one lady was literally falling asleep at the table two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake the main was again very average and cold the sea menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food we complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further minutes at least the atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had glasses of wine all evening so the new year came and went without many people noticing the couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight we had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types overall the service was average and very very slow at euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average we believe the ad hoc tasting menu with wine is normally euros and i think hiking the price up to euros per person was a mistake as the food service did not live up to the price we have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a nye meal for the price they charged we wish we had popped into a local trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the pizazza del popolo incidentally we had planned to watch the fireworks in the piazza del popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took hours a very very disappointing evening,436,"['visit', 'ad', 'hoc', 'nye', 'husband', 'disappoint', 'even', 'set', 'menu', 'wine', 'pair', 'set', 'price', 'euro',

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Stay clear of this place!,,after a day vacation in italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening allthough i must admit our holiday was full of special meals having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior and i liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes they had room for us plenty of empty tables that evening actually sunday nov since we had been really overeating the whole trip and i hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant we decided to just go for the secondi piatti and skip the antipasti well good for us that we did we did get the complementary sparkling white whine and then went for the lobster on my part and four tryout meatcourses for hubby i agree with others the servings were really small and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway plates were cold sucking the warmth out of the food my lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold dry rice lobster was ok as the strings of honeyglazed lemons as a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew and the parmeggiano well i am no expert but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano dry and tasteless my husbands glass of wine was more like one fourth glass and measured digitally mind you we wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it and really didn´t touch it but lo and behold they charged us for the bread not even in the cheapest joint but here oh yes and € it was by the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the eversweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh thank god for speaking an unusual language swedish and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot the whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man the owner kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant at one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice but to no avail he remained very serous end stern everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill so strange and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this if so eager why didn´t he do the charging himself all in all a total flop for the prices they charge there are so many other good restaurants in rome so do avoid this one,510,"['day', 'vacat', 'itali', 'want', 'realli', 'special', 'meal',

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Stay clear of this place!,,after a day vacation in italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening allthough i must admit our holiday was full of special meals having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior and i liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes they had room for us plenty of empty tables that evening actually sunday nov since we had been really overeating the whole trip and i hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant we decided to just go for the secondi piatti and skip the antipasti well good for us that we did we did get the complementary sparkling white whine and then went for the lobster on my part and four tryout meatcourses for hubby i agree with others the servings were really small and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway plates were cold sucking the warmth out of the food my lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold dry rice lobster was ok as the strings of honeyglazed lemons as a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew and the parmeggiano well i am no expert but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano dry and tasteless my husbands glass of wine was more like one fourth glass and measured digitally mind you we wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it and really didn´t touch it but lo and behold they charged us for the bread not even in the cheapest joint but here oh yes and € it was by the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the eversweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh thank god for speaking an unusual language swedish and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot the whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man the owner kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant at one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice but to no avail he remained very serous end stern everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill so strange and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this if so eager why didn´t he do the charging himself all in all a total flop for the prices they charge there are so many other good restaurants in rome so do avoid this one,510,"['day', 'vacat', 'itali',

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",,visited ad hoc for nye with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening it was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of euros each we arrived at pm and were greeted with a small glass of prosecco a nice touch but we then waited hour for our starter and our first glass of wine the starter was very average we then waited hours for our main and we we still hadnt had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine the waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had glass of prosecco and glass of wine in hours was just not good enough the two couples next to us also asked for more wine one lady was literally falling asleep at the table two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake the main was again very average and cold the sea menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food we complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further minutes at least the atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had glasses of wine all evening so the new year came and went without many people noticing the couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight we had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types overall the service was average and very very slow at euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average we believe the ad hoc tasting menu with wine is normally euros and i think hiking the price up to euros per person was a mistake as the food service did not live up to the price we have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a nye meal for the price they charged we wish we had popped into a local trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the pizazza del popolo incidentally we had planned to watch the fireworks in the piazza del popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took hours a very very disappointing evening,436,"['visit', 'ad', 'hoc', 'nye', 'husband', 'disappoint', 'even', 'set', 'menu', 'wine', 'pair',

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Stay clear of this place!,,after a day vacation in italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening allthough i must admit our holiday was full of special meals having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior and i liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes they had room for us plenty of empty tables that evening actually sunday nov since we had been really overeating the whole trip and i hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant we decided to just go for the secondi piatti and skip the antipasti well good for us that we did we did get the complementary sparkling white whine and then went for the lobster on my part and four tryout meatcourses for hubby i agree with others the servings were really small and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway plates were cold sucking the warmth out of the food my lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold dry rice lobster was ok as the strings of honeyglazed lemons as a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew and the parmeggiano well i am no expert but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano dry and tasteless my husbands glass of wine was more like one fourth glass and measured digitally mind you we wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it and really didn´t touch it but lo and behold they charged us for the bread not even in the cheapest joint but here oh yes and € it was by the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the eversweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh thank god for speaking an unusual language swedish and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot the whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man the owner kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant at one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice but to no avail he remained very serous end stern everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill so strange and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this if so eager why didn´t he do the charging himself all in all a total flop for the prices they charge there are so many other good restaurants in rome so do avoid this one,510,"['day', 'vacat', 'itali',

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",,visited ad hoc for nye with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening it was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of euros each we arrived at pm and were greeted with a small glass of prosecco a nice touch but we then waited hour for our starter and our first glass of wine the starter was very average we then waited hours for our main and we we still hadnt had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine the waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had glass of prosecco and glass of wine in hours was just not good enough the two couples next to us also asked for more wine one lady was literally falling asleep at the table two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake the main was again very average and cold the sea menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food we complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further minutes at least the atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had glasses of wine all evening so the new year came and went without many people noticing the couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight we had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types overall the service was average and very very slow at euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average we believe the ad hoc tasting menu with wine is normally euros and i think hiking the price up to euros per person was a mistake as the food service did not live up to the price we have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a nye meal for the price they charged we wish we had popped into a local trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the pizazza del popolo incidentally we had planned to watch the fireworks in the piazza del popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took hours a very very disappointing evening,436,"['visit', 'ad', 'hoc', 'nye', 'husband', 'disappoint', 'even', 'set', 'menu', 'wine', 'pair',

Russia,Pelmenya,Positive,Delectable Dumplings!,,whilst i would not recommend this eatery for dinner it makes a perfect pit stop for a hearty cheap and filling lunch no one should visit this part of the world without trying dumplings meat or vegetables encased in an unleavened dough which are then boiled and sometimes fried they are a historic food staple and cherished part of the russian and central asian diet at pelmenya you can experiment with a variety of dumplings including the famous russian pelmeni but also ukrainian vareniki georgian khinkali uzbek manti and also chinese dim sum and italian ravioli we naturally tried pelmeni resembling tortellini stuffed with ground beef and then boiled vareniki crescent shaped crimped parcels containing mashed potato and boiled khinkali large purse shaped spicy dumplings stuffed with pork and beef boiled and then fried that contain a mouthwatering savoury broth and manti containing spicy minced lamb that are boiled other fillings both savoury and sweet are available our choices came with a variety of condiments including fried onions and sour cream all except the khinkali which are supposed to be consumed plain and without the use of knives or forks you should eat them with your hands leaving just the ‘stalk’ or ‘kudi’ of the dumpling where the pleats meet which is tough we particularly liked the fact that you could chose how many pieces of each dumpling to try you’d want rather more pelmeni than khinkali and the menu was in english as well as russian the waiting staff were very helpful and pleasant and spoke good english the restaurant has a hip modern vibe with free wifi although i would not want to sit for long on the high wooden chairs opting instead for a more comfortable circular table there are a variety of beverages on offer but surprisingly only one russian beer – baltica which is a something of a shame as beer goes so well with dumplings and it would be nice to see this business supporting the
